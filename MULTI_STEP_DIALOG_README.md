# Multi-Step Dialog Implementation

## Features Completed

✅ **Modern Multi-Step Dialog Component**

- Command palette-style UI with modern design
- Step-by-step navigation with progress indicator
- Keyboard shortcuts for navigation (Enter, Escape, Ctrl+Left/Right)
- Proper validation and error handling
- Auto-focus on inputs
- Click-to-navigate on completed steps

✅ **File Creation Enhancement**

- Two-step process for files: name + extension
- Single-step process for folders: name only
- Form validation (required fields, character restrictions)
- Real-time error feedback

✅ **Integration with Command Palette**

- "New File" and "New Folder" commands now open the multi-step dialog
- Command palette closes automatically when creating files
- Shared state management between components

✅ **Integration with Context Menu**

- Right-click context menu still works for file/folder creation
- Same multi-step dialog experience from both entry points

## How to Test

1. **From Command Palette:**

   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open command palette
   - Type "New File" or "New Folder"
   - Select the command to open the multi-step dialog

2. **From Context Menu:**

   - Right-click in empty space in file explorer
   - Click "Create File" or "Create Folder"
   - Multi-step dialog will open

3. **Navigation Features:**
   - Use `Enter` to proceed to next step or create
   - Use `Escape` to cancel
   - Use `Ctrl+Left` to go back a step
   - Use `Ctrl+Right` to go forward (if validation passes)
   - Click on completed step numbers to navigate back

## Technical Implementation

- **Component:** `MultiStepDialog.tsx` - Reusable multi-step dialog component
- **State Management:** Shared `createFileDialogAtom` in store
- **File Handling:** Enhanced handlers that process step values
- **Validation:** Per-step validation with custom error messages
- **UI/UX:** Command palette-inspired design with modern styling

The implementation successfully replaces the old single-field dialog with a modern, extensible multi-step workflow that can be easily adapted for other use cases requiring multiple inputs.
