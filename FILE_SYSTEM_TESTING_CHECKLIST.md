- [ ] Type new name → Press Enter
- [ ] ✅ Verify: Item renamed with success toast
- [ ] Try renaming with existing name → ✅ Verify: Error message
- [ ] Test Escape key → ✅ Verify: Dialog cancels

### 6. **Delete Testing**

- [ ] ✅ Verify: File deleted with success toast
- [ ] Right-click on folder → "Delete"
- [ ] ✅ Verify: Folder and contents deleted
- [ ] Try deleting non-existent file → ✅ Verify: Error handling

### 7. **Validation Testing**

- [ ] Try creating file with "/" in name → ✅ Verify: Validation error
- [ ] Try creating file with very long name → ✅ Verify: Length error
- [ ] Try creating empty filename → ✅ Verify: Required field error
- [ ] Try extension with "." → ✅ Verify: Extension validation error

### 8. **Keyboard Navigation**

- [ ] In rename dialog: Enter → Confirms, Escape → Cancels
- [ ] In multi-step dialog: All shortcuts work (`Ctrl+Left`, `Ctrl+Right`, etc.)
- [ ] Tab navigation works in all dialogs

### 9. **Error Handling**

- [ ] Try operations without permissions → ✅ Verify: Proper error toast
- [ ] Try operations on non-existent paths → ✅ Verify: Error handling
- [ ] Network drive operations (if applicable) → ✅ Verify: Graceful handling

### 10. **Visual Feedback**

- [ ] Success operations show green toast notifications
- [ ] Error operations show red toast notifications
- [ ] Toast descriptions are informative and helpful
- [ ] Context menu items enable/disable appropriately
- [ ] Paste button disabled when clipboard empty

### 11. **Integration Testing**

- [ ] Terminal continues working after file operations
- [ ] Theme switching works with all dialogs
- [ ] File list refreshes automatically after operations
- [ ] Selected files clear appropriately after operations

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**All tests pass ✅**

- No console errors during any operations
- All toast notifications appear with correct messages
- File system state stays consistent
- UI remains responsive during operations
- Keyboard shortcuts work as expected
- Error conditions handled gracefully

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Copy Operation**: Shows "not implemented" message - this is expected as file copying requires additional backend implementation
2. **Large Files**: No progress indication for very large file operations
3. **Network Drives**: May have different behavior depending on OS and permissions

## 🔄 If Issues Found

1. **Check Console**: Open DevTools (F12) for error messages
2. **Restart App**: Close and restart if state becomes inconsistent
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure write access to target directories
4. **Platform Differences**: Some operations may behave differently on different OS

## ✨ Expected Results

After all tests pass, you should have:

- Fully functional file creation with multi-step dialogs
- Working copy/cut/paste operations (except file copying)
- Reliable rename functionality with validation
- Safe delete operations with confirmation
- Modern toast notification system
- Responsive and intuitive user interface

**Ready for production use! 🚀**
